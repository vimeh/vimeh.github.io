No 3D printing, no flashing ROS and building images from source in virtual machines, and definitely no multiplication to figure out the right specs for motors. Just a straight, simple, assemble the frame, throw on the motors, stick on a Pixhawk, mix in a DJI FPV system, and make sure not to violate any FCC or FAA regulations. Truly, this is the simple way.</p>\n<p>Well, I've gotten all the components, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. Sometimes the simplest things take the longest. In that time, DJI release a complete FPV drone package, but I'd still like my build because I do want to get back into messing around with the autopilot and have a deeper insight into what's going on in the flight controller. And because I'm stubborn like that?</p>\n<p>Anyway, the plan is to use <a href=\"https://shop.holybro.com/x500-kit_p1180.html\">this Pixhawk devkit</a> and <a href=\"https://store.dji.com/category/dji-fpv\">the DJI FPV flight system</a>. I decided to spring for a <a href=\"https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/260/RSP_1000_SPEC-1511917.pdf\">decently capable power supply</a> and <a href=\"https://www.progressiverc.com/products/icharger-x8\">balance charger</a> because I must have gone through at least four, and I figure if I should stop giving them away and just hold on to one set. Oh, and I needed some <a href=\"https://www.soko-heli-tools.com/calculators\">4S LiPos</a>. </p>\n<p>Next stop, assemble the beast. Third quad's the charm.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 2020","start":"July 2020","end":null,"slug":"/posts/fpvdrone","title":"FPV Drone"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/fpvdrone"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
