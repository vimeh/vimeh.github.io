It was our first time building a quadcopter, and quite honestly, it's hard and scary, and there's no where to fly them in NYC.</p>\n<p>I don't think this really counts, but it was fun and it taught me a lot about how bureaucracies are slow when it comes to risk. As part of engineering student council, my council and I had an event where we flew little RC quads through an obstacle course. Fun event, and also the first time I really ever discussed liability with a lawyer.</p>\n<p>Then there was that startup for drone delivery. We actually did get some decent seed funding from a venture competition, but I think that sort of fizzled out. First time I had to think about IP issues, and international ones at that.</p>\n<p>Finally, I joined up with the Robotics club to spin up a drone club, more as a community than as a project. We did get an Intel Aero dev kit to build up knowledge to compete in a competition, but I think the learning curve was a problem for all of us. </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 2015","start":"October 2015","end":"March 2018","slug":"/posts/mehdrones","title":"A few drones more"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/mehdrones"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
